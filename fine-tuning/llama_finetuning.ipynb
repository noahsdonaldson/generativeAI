    "We are going to use the method in the paper \"[QLoRA: Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adapter Tuning for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)\" by Tim Dettmers et al. QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.\n",
    "* Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)\n",
    "* Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_clm.py](./scripts/run_clm.py), which implements QLora using PEFT to train our model. The script also merges the LoRA weights into the model weights after training. That way you can use the model as a normal model without any additional code. The model will be temporally offloaded to disk, if it is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a sagemaker training job we need an `HuggingFace` Estimator. The Estimator handles end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training and deployment tasks. The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. \n",
    "SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n",
